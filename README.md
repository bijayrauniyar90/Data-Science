Welcome to my Data Science Learning Journey repository! This repository is designed to document and organize my progress as I delve into 
the fascinating world of data science. 

Here's the structured plan I'll be following:

Week 1 - Basics of Python Programming: I'll start by mastering the fundamentals of Python, an essential language in the field of data science.
Week 2 - Python Data Types: Building upon my Python skills, I'll explore different data types and their manipulation.
Week 3 - Object-Oriented Programming: Understanding OOP principles will enhance my coding efficiency and data handling capabilities.
Week 4 - Advanced Python: Delving deeper into Python, I'll learn advanced concepts and techniques for data analysis and manipulation.
Week 5 - Numpy: Numpy will be my tool for efficient numerical computations and array operations.
Week 6 - Pandas: Mastering Pandas will empower me to work with structured data and perform data wrangling tasks.
Week 7 & 8 - Advanced Pandas: Exploring advanced features of Pandas for more complex data transformations and analysis.
Week 9 & 10 - Data Visualization: Learning visualization techniques using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate insights effectively.
Week 11 & 12 - Data Analysis Process: Understanding the complete data analysis process from data cleaning to modeling and interpretation.
Week 13 to 16 - SQL Mastery: Diving into SQL basics, continued learning, and advanced SQL for database querying and management.
Week 17 - Descriptive Statistics: Exploring statistical methods to summarize and interpret data effectively.

I'll be continuously updating this repository with my learning materials, code snippets, project progress, and reflections on each topic.
Join me on this exciting journey as I explore the vast landscape of data science and its applications.
